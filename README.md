# 🛒 E-commerce Data Engineering Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focused on building a **Hadoop-based data engineering pipeline** using real-world E-commerce data from platforms like **Flipkart**, **eBay**, and **Newegg**. The primary goal was to set up a distributed system and execute business-related queries using SQL on the processed data.

## 🧪 Project Workflow

### 1. 🧩 Domain & Data Sources
- **Domain:** E-commerce  
- **Sources:** Flipkart, eBay, Newegg

---

### 2. 🌐 Network & Cluster Setup

- **Tailscale Integration:**  
  Logged into Tailscale to establish a secure mesh network for node connectivity.

- **Worker Node Initialization:**  
  Each team member’s machine hosted at least one worker node.

- **Authorization:**  
  Approved each node through the Tailscale dashboard.

---

### 3. 🖥️ Hadoop Cluster Configuration

- Deployed a Hadoop cluster with 1 master and 4 worker nodes.  
- Verified the setup via the **HDFS Web UI**.
- Ran test jobs to ensure that all nodes were live and functioning.

---

### 4. 🗃️ Data Processing & Query Execution

- Developed **SQL queries** to answer critical business questions based on an E-R diagram.  
- Validated output by comparing results with known expectations.

---

### 5. 🎤 Presentation & Demo Video

- Created a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project.  
- Recorded and edited a walkthrough video including:
  - Hadoop Cluster Setup  
  - Data Flow Overview  
  - SQL Query Results  
- Included visual demonstrations to improve clarity and engagement.
